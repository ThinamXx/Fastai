## **Fastai : Introduction Notebook**

The [**Introduction**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/blob/main/1.%20Introduction/Introduction.ipynb) notebook is a comprehensive notebook as it contains a list of projects such as **Cat and Dog Classification**, **Semantic Segmentation**, **Sentiment Classification**, **Tabular Classification** and **Recommendation System**.


**1. Cat and Dog Classification**
- I will download and extract a dataset called the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset that contains 7349 images of cats and dogs from 37 breeds from the fast.ai datasets collection to the GPU server. I will use pretrained model that has already been trained on 1.3 million images. The pretrained model will be fine tuned using the latest advances in transfer learning to create a model that is specially customized for recognizing dogs and cats. I have presented the implementation of Cat and Dog Classification using Fastai here in the snapshot.

**2. Semantic Segmentation**
- Creating a model that can recognize the content of every individual pixel in an image is called Segmentation. 

**3. Sentiment Classification**
- I will create a model that can classify the sentiment of a movie review. Computers can now generate text, translate automatically from one language to another, analyze comments, label words in sentences with the advancement of deep learning in Natural Language Processing. I have presented the implementation of Semantic Segmentation and Sentiment Classification using Fastai here in the snapshot.

**4. Tabular Classification**
- The model will be using [**Adult**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) dataset which contains some demographic data about individuals such as their education, marital status, race, sex and whether they have an annual income greater than $50k.

**5. Recommendation System**
- I will train a model that will predict movies people might like based on their previous viewing habits using [**MovieLens Dataset**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2827872).
