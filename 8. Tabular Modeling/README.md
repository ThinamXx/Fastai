# **Fastai : Tabular Modeling**

The [**Tabular Model**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/blob/main/8.%20Tabular%20Modeling/TabularModel.ipynb) notebook contains all the dependencies required for **Tabular Modeling**. It presents the detailed explanations of two approaches to **Tabular Modeling: Decision Tree Ensembles and Neural Networks**.

**Loading the Data**
- I will use the dataset from [**Blue Book for Bulldozers Kaggle Competition**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview) here. I have presented the implementation of Handling Dates, Tabular Pandas and Tabular Proc using Fastai and PyTorch here in the snapshot.

**Random Forest**
- A Random Forest is a model that averages the predictions of a large number of decision trees which are generated by randomly varying various parameters that specify what data is used to train the tree and other tree parameters. Bagging is a particular approach to ensembling or combining the results of multiple models together. Random Forest Model just averages the predictions of a number of trees and therefore it can never predict values outside the range of the training data. Random Forests are not able to extrapolate outside the types of data i.e out of domain data.

**Out of Bag Error**
- The Out of Bag Error or OOB error is a way of measuring prediction error in the training dataset by including in the calculation of a rows error trees only where that row was not included in the training. I have presented the implementation of Creating Random Forest and Model Interpretation using Fastai and PyTorch here in the snapshot.
