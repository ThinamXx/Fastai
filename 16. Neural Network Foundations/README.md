# **Fastai : Neural Network Foundations**

The [**Neural Foundations**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/blob/main/16.%20Neural%20Network%20Foundations/NeuralFoundations.ipynb) notebook contains all the dependencies required to understand the foundations of deep learning, begining with matrix multiplication and moving on to implementing the forward and backward passes of a neural net from scratch.
