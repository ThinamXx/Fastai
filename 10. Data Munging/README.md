# **Fastai : Data Munging**

The [**DataMunging**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/blob/main/10.%20Data%20Munging/DataMunging.ipynb) notebook contains all the dependencies required to implement mid level API of **Fast.ai** in **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision** which provides greater flexibility to apply transformations on data items. 

**IMDB Dataset:**
- I have presented the implementation of Creating Data Loaders, Tokenization and Numericalization using Fastai and PyTorch here in the snapshot.

**Decorator:**
- Python has a special syntax for passing a function to another function or something that behaves like a function which is also known as callable in Python is called a Decorator. A Decorator is used by prepending a callable with @ and placing it before the function definition. 

**Datasets:**
- Datasets will apply two or more pipelines in parallel to the same raw object and build a tuple with the result. It will automatically do the setup and index into a Datasets. I have presented the implementation of Datasets Class, Transformed Collections and Data Loaders using Fastai and PyTorch here in the snapshot.
