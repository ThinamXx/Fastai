The [**NLP**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/blob/main/9.%20Natural%20Language%20Processing/NLP.ipynb) notebook contains all the dependencies required build **Language Model** that can generate texts and a **Classifier Model** that determines whether a review is positive or negative. It presents the state of art **Classifier Model** which is build using a pretrained language model and fine tuned it to the corpus of task. Then the **Encoder** model is used for classification.
