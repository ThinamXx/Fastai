# **DEEP LEARNING FOR CODERS WITH FASTAI AND PYTORCH**

The repository contains a list of the projects which I have worked on while reading the book [**Deep Learning For Coders with Fastai and PyTorch**](https://course.fast.ai/#). 

### **ðŸ“šNOTEBOOKS:**

[**1. INTRODUCTION**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/1.%20Introduction)
- The **Introduction** notebook is a comprehensive notebook as it contains a list of projects such as **Cat and Dog Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Sentiment Classification, Tabular Classification and Recommendation System**.

[**2. MODEL PRODUCTION**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/2.%20Model%20Production)
- The **BearDetector notebook** contains all the dependencies for a complete Image Classification project.

[**3. TRAINING A CLASSIFIER**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/3.%20Training%20a%20Classifier)
- The **DigitClassifier** notebook contains all the dependencies required for Image Classification project from scratch.

[**4. IMAGE CLASSIFICATION**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/4.%20Image%20Classification)
- The **Image Classification** notebook contains all the dependencies for Image Classification such as getting image data ready for modeling i.e presizing and data block summary and for fitting the model i.e learning rate finder, unfreezing, discriminative learning rates, setting the number of epochs and using deeper architectures. It has explanations of cross entropy loss function as well.

[**5. MULTILABEL CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/5.%20MultilabelClassification%20Regression) 
- The **Multilabel Classification** notebook contains all the dependencies required to understand **Multilabel Classification**. It contains the explanations of initializing **DataBlock** and **DataLoaders**. The **Regression** notebook contains all the dependencies required to understand **Image Regression**.

[**6. COLLABORATIVE FILTERING**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/7.%20Collaborative%20Filtering)
- The **Collaborative Filtering** notebook contains all the dependencies required to build a **Recommendation System**. It presents how gradient descent can learn intrinsic factors or biases about items from a history of ratings which then gives information about the data.
