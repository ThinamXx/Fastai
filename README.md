- The **NLP** notebook contains all the dependencies required build Language Model that can generate texts and a Classifier Model that determines whether a review is positive or negative. It presents the state of art Classifier Model which is build using a pretrained language model and fine tuned it to the corpus of task. Then the Encoder model is used for classification.

[**10. DATA MUNGING**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/10.%20Data%20Munging)
- The **DataMunging** notebook contains all the dependencies required to implement mid level API of Fast.ai in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision which provides greater flexibility to apply transformations on data items.

[**11. LANGUAGE MODEL FROM SCRATCH**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/11.%20Language%20Model)
- The **LanguageModel** notebook contains all the dependencies that is inside AWD-LSTM architecture for Text Classification. It presents the implementation of Language Model using simple Linear Model, Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory, Dropout Regularization and Activation Regularization.

[**12. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/12.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)
- The **CNN** notebook contains all the dependencies required to understand Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutions are just a type of matrix multiplication with two constraints on the weight matrix: some elements are always zero and some elements are tied or forced to always have the same value.

[**13. RESIDUAL NETWORKS**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/13.%20ResNets)
- The **ResNets** notebook contains all the dependencies required to understand the implementation of skip connections which allow deeper models to be trained. ResNet is the pretrained model when using **Transfer Learning**.

[**14. ARCHITECTURE DETAILS**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/14.%20Architecture%20Details)
- The **Architecture Details** notebook contains all the dependencies required to create a complete state of art computer vision models. It presents some aspects of natural language processing as well.

[**15. TRAINING PROCESS**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/tree/main/15.%20Training%20Process)
- The **Training** notebook contains all the dependencies required to create a training loop and explored variants of Stochastic Gradient Descent.
