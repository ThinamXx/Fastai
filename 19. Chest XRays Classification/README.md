**DICOM Files**
- DICOM stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine. It is the de-facto standard that establishes rules that allow the medical images and associated information to be exchanged between imaging equipment from different vendors, computers and hospitals. I have presented the implementation of Initializing Data Block and Data Loaders, Training Pretrained Model and Interpretation using Fastai and PyTorch here in the snapshot.

**Sensitivity & Specificity**
- Sensitivity = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative). It is also known as a Type II Error. Specificity = True Negative / (False Positive + True Negative). It is also known as a Type I Error. I have presented the implementation of Confusion Matrix, Sensitivity and Specificity, Accuracy using Fastai and PyTorch here in the snapshot.
