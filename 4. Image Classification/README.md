# **Fastai : Image Classification**

The [**Image Classification**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Fastai/blob/main/4.%20Image%20Classification/ImageClassification.ipynb) notebook contains all the dependencies such as getting image data ready for modeling i.e presizing and data block summary and for fitting the model i.e learning rate finder, unfreezing, discriminative learning rates, setting the number of epochs and using deeper architectures. It has explanations of cross entropy loss function as well.
